# React Redux Immer Object Exercise

## This project was completed from scratch as part of Dave Ceddia's Pure Redux course

The objective of the exercise is to learn how to use the earlier methods of redux (connect, etc.) and
immer for making immutable updates mutably. This exercise involved updating state for an Airplane
component. The state was an object with an embedded object and array.
